# Known bugs

(Pending putting this on GitHub and adding some issues)

* Some reports (notably draw_tsundoku) will blow up if Colorama is not
  installed - the intention is that instead it should gracefully fall back to
  monochrome output
* Colour configuration for tsundoku is undocumented (although it is likely to
  get a bit of a tweak imminently)
* Supported property names for filter arguments are undocumented (outside of
  book.py)
