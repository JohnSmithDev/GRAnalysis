# The reports

The reports broadly break down into 3 categories

* Reports to interrogate your data e.g. books which are on multiple shelves
* Reports on books you have read e.g. favourite authors/shelves/decades
* Reports on books you haven't read e.g. least read shelves/decades,
  visualization of to-be-read pile (aka TBR aka Mount Tsundoku)
